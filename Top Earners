We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

Input Format

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

#OLVED 
SELECT MAX(total_earnings), 
COUNT(*) AS num_employee_with_max
FROM (
    SELECT salary * months AS total_earnings
    FROM Employee
) AS Sub_query
WHERE total_earnings = (SELECT MAX(salary * months) FROM Employee);
